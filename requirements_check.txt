HRA LEGAL 

@AMEY: 

	•	Website reference for our firm. The closest that I can provide is the CAM website. There are many great websites of law firms, but the way my content is, I believe this is apt for you to understand and relate.   

	•	COLOR: Either needs a little tone down beige or sand color. This is too much brown. OR preferably if you can use this same exact color combo (slight beige-peach) as shown on https://www.artisanlab.in/. 

	•	FONTS: Ours needs to be 2 sizes less. We have to work on space & font legibility. Refer CAM here as well. Pls see their header and footer is so sleek, with small but legible fonts, also the entire content and pointers are small yet precise and sharp. You can use Helvetica or Proxima. 

	•	Firm Name: Need HRA Legal to be looking like the below image. Can you do it for now- bracketed form? I could in ppt which I sent to you earlier, in word I cannot. Hence, I’ve pasted image here for you to replicate.

 


	•	Red Color: keep firm name in same color “black” and when you take the cursor you can make it change to “entire red colored font” or “red underlined HRA LEGAL, with shapes changing into dark beige”? 

	•	Icons: We can use less of icons in Practice Areas and instead keep bullets like “Corporate   “ in this form. I mean don’t use icons everywhere. It dilutes the aesthetics. 

	•	Header titles: Change it to red colored font with red underlined. All headers have sub-headers, Refer CAM - we need exactly same. Pls hover around and see once

	•	Footer: See CAM – their footer is sleek. With location and links ton social media pages etc. All info fits here perfectly in half page. 

	•	Consistency: Here too refer CAM. Even for HRA Legal: Our main tabs are “Home, About Us, Practice Areas, Sectors, Knowledge Centre, Contact Us”. Wherever you link these tabs the content should remain same and consistent including the titles/categories etc

	•	Home Page Revisions:

	•	“Get Legal Consultation”: Don’t highlight it much. Can keep same color with maybe underlined in diff color. Although I’d like to delete but we can retain for leads and ease of access. 

	•	Home page Start: We really need to work on this. If the visual is not happening, then let me know if I should give you Our own office pics which you can use as watermark background, OR if you want to use certain professional general image as a background; and in center mention “HRA Legal and its intro etc” or we can mention some quote.



	•	Trusted by: delete. 

	•	Why Choose us: Don’t write twice. In brown circle its fine. Then no need to write in full question mark sentence. Everything else is fine with icons and content. 


	•	Ready to experience : Delete entirely

	•	Services: 



Again, no need to mention twice. Rest is fine including icons and content. Just that delete “End to End Legal Services” sentence and let it either appear after secondary services or can change and move above before primary services.  

	•	Practice Areas on Home Page: This is most important for me. 

	•	You can refer CAM pls. that’s perfect for practice areas. You can see where and how they appear on pages and whether it appears on Home page or expertise page, it takes you to same content. We can use same method. 
	•	Don’t use different terminology of categories. Has to be same.  
	•	Also, under “Practice Areas – Expertise Areas and Developing Areas” are sub headers”. See sub headers created by them as well.  



	•	Need legal assistance: delete. One on topmost header and plus at footer contact us is more than enuf. We don’t need to repeat so many times
	•	Your trusted legal partner: delete. These are not true facts. Also, these are facts of my employment so these can be mentioned where my intro as founder will be given. 
	•	Founder: Only Rushi. Remove Ami. My intro can be pasted as is as given below. You can insert my photo – I’ll send it to you. Later on, we can change it. 
	•	Combined Legal Excellence : either deleted or revised. Since now ami’s intro will be deleted. 
	•	Experienced Legal Leadership Tab: To be revised. 

	•	Now on “About Us” page revisions:
	•	Leadership Team: Delete. Instead, will be ‘meet the founder…with her expertise and passion….’.  The tabs below that will change. 
	•	Rushi Upadhyaya intro. I liked this. This is fine. But just need to highlight and mention all the companies where I have worked. Its mentioned in my intro below. 

	•	Experience Excellence in leadership : Its ok if you retain or delete. Anything works. 
	•	Story : I’ll send it to you. 
	•	Mission Vision, Culture, Values – all is fine with content and icons. 
	•	Ready to work with us- Get Started? This sounds more for prospective candidates to apply for job. Delete this. We don’t need it. 

	•	Practice Areas Tab: I have to go through once to see if all my specializations are covered. Give me some time for this Amey. 

In developing areas, please “transactional services” from all. Just mention the headers.


	•	Sectors Tab: Featured Media to come first. Also, pls use all 3 “Technology, Media, & Telecommunications”
	•	Learners Page: Delete fully “stay informed etc… Because presently, I don’t want to mention that its from expert analysis and experienced legal team. Same changes at the end where its written to subscribe. Just mention “To subscribe to our articles, blogs”. Rest all seems fine.  


	•	Contact Us: 
	•	Send us message box is good. Just change “Ready to discuss etc” to “For inquiries, please fill in the form below and we will revert shortly”
	•	Add location map. 
	•	Email Id needs to be info@hralegal.com or something like that and not my email id. 
	•	Also for now my mobile number is ok but can we change at a later date Amey? 
	•	Delete Office Hours completely. 
	•	Entire Page make it little subtle font size – Refer CAM. 

	•	Terms of Use, Privacy Policy and Site Disclaimer” – Pls use what I have sent. Only pending is terms of use/terms and conditions. I’ll send it to you this week for sure.
