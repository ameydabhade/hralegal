# cPanel Deployment Guide for HRA Legal Website

## âœ… Project Status: Ready for Deployment!

Your project has been successfully configured for cPanel hosting with static export.

## Prerequisites
- cPanel hosting account with file manager access
- Node.js support (if available) or static file hosting
- Domain/subdomain configured

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Build the Project Locally âœ… COMPLETED
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
**Status**: Build successful! Static files generated in `out` folder.

### 2. Environment Variables Setup
- Copy the content from `env.example` to create `.env.local`
- Fill in your actual Sanity credentials:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`: Your Sanity project ID (currently set to 'mvclci23')
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET`: Usually 'production'

### 3. Upload Files to cPanel

#### âœ… Static Export (RECOMMENDED - Ready to Deploy)
1. After running `npm run build`, you'll find an `out` folder with all static files
2. Upload the **entire contents** of the `out` folder to your domain's `public_html` directory
3. Make sure the `index.html` file is in the root of `public_html`
4. All dynamic pages (blog posts and news) are pre-generated as static HTML

#### Alternative: Node.js Hosting (if supported by your cPanel provider)
1. Upload the entire project folder
2. Install dependencies: `npm install --production`
3. Set up the start script in cPanel's Node.js settings
4. Configure environment variables in cPanel's Node.js environment settings

### 4. Configure Domain/Subdomain
- Ensure your domain points to the correct directory
- If using a subdirectory, uncomment and modify the `assetPrefix` and `basePath` in next.config.js

### 5. SSL Configuration
- Enable SSL/HTTPS in cPanel
- Update any hardcoded HTTP URLs to HTTPS

## âœ… What's Included in the Static Export

### Generated Pages (34 total):
- âœ… All static pages (homepage, about, contact, practice areas, etc.)
- âœ… Pre-generated blog post: `/blog/test-post-new-acc`
- âœ… Pre-generated news update: `/news/test-news`
- âœ… All fonts and assets properly included
- âœ… Optimized for SEO with metadata

### File Structure in cPanel:
```
public_html/
â”œâ”€â”€ _next/           # Next.js assets and JavaScript
â”œâ”€â”€ fonts/           # Custom Kohinoor fonts
â”œâ”€â”€ Logos/           # Company logos
â”œâ”€â”€ blog/            # Static blog pages
â”œâ”€â”€ news/            # Static news pages
â”œâ”€â”€ practice-areas/  # All practice area pages
â”œâ”€â”€ 404.html         # Error page
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html       # Homepage
â””â”€â”€ [other static pages]
```

## Important Notes

### âœ… Static vs Dynamic Content
- **All pages are now static** - perfect for cPanel hosting
- Blog and news pages are pre-generated at build time
- New blog/news posts will require rebuilding and redeploying

### âœ… Image Optimization
- Image optimization is disabled for static export compatibility
- Images will still load correctly
- All remote images (Sanity CDN) will work properly

### Updates Process
1. Make changes locally
2. Run `npm run build`
3. Upload new `out` folder contents to cPanel
4. Clear any caches if applicable

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **404 errors**: Check if files are in the correct directory
2. **Images not loading**: Verify image paths and ensure images are in the `out` folder
3. **Environment variables not working**: Ensure they're set correctly and start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
4. **Trailing slash issues**: The project is configured with `trailingSlash: true` for better compatibility

### Pre-build Verification âœ…
- [x] Project builds successfully
- [x] No TypeScript errors
- [x] All dynamic routes have generateStaticParams
- [x] Static export configuration is working
- [x] Environment variables are properly configured

## Performance Tips
- Enable gzip compression in cPanel
- Set up caching rules for static assets
- Use a CDN if available through your hosting provider
- The site is already optimized for fast loading

## ðŸš€ Ready to Deploy!
Your project is fully prepared for cPanel hosting. Simply upload the contents of the `out` folder to your cPanel's `public_html` directory.
